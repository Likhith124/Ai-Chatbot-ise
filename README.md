# ü§ñ DAIT AI Chatbot

An AI-powered virtual assistant built using **Dialogflow ES** for **Dr. Ambedkar Institute of Technology (DAIT)**. This chatbot provides instant answers to frequently asked questions from students, faculty, and visitors through a web interface.

---

## üìò Project Overview

This project involves the design and development of an AI chatbot intended to act as a first-line support system. It helps users by providing information about:

- Academic programs
- Departments
- Admissions
- Campus facilities
- Placements and more

The chatbot uses **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** to interpret user queries and respond conversationally. It is accessible through a web-based chat interface and is extendable to platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram.

## üéØ Objectives

1. Develop an intelligent virtual assistant using Dialogflow.
2. Automate FAQs and student support for DAIT.
3. Reduce administrative workload.
4. Ensure 24/7 access to information via a user-friendly interface.
5. Demonstrate AI and NLP application in an academic setting.
6. Create a scalable system for future enhancements (voice support, multilingual, backend integration).

## ‚öô Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Dialogflow Agent

* Go to [Dialogflow Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/)
* Create an agent named `DAIT_Chatbot`
* Set language to English, timezone to IST
* Link with Google Cloud Project

### Step 2: Define Intents

* **Department Info Intent**
* **Placement Info Intent**
* **Contact/Location Intent**

### Step 3: Create Entities

* `@department_names` ‚Üí ,"ISE","CSE", "Mechanical", etc.
* `@course_type` ‚Üí "B.E.", "M.Tech", etc.
* System entities like `@sys.date`, `@sys.number` also used

### Step 4: Add Training Phrases & Responses

* Add user phrases for each intent
* Add static text responses (or connect to webhook for dynamic)

### Step 5: Fulfillment (Optional)

* Enable webhook under Fulfillment tab
* Use Node.js or Python backend
